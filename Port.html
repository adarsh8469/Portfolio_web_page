            <h1>Project Work</h1>
            <h3><li>Url Shortner Using Django</li></h3>
            <br>
            <span class = "detail">The project aims to develop a URL shortener using the Django web framework. A URL shortener is a tool that takes long and complex URLs and generates shortened versions that are easier to share and remember.
                The key features of the project include:
                <li>User Registration and Authentication: Users can register and log in to the application to access additional features and keep track of their shortened URLs.</li>
                <li>URL Shortening: The application allows users to input long URLs and generates a unique and shorter URL for each input. This shortened URL redirects to the original long URL when accessed.</li>
                <li>Customized Short URLs: Users have the option to customize the generated short URLs with a specific keyword or phrase, making them more memorable and meaningful.</li>
                <li>Analytics and Statistics: The application tracks the number of times each shortened URL is accessed, providing users with insights and statistics about their links' popularity.</li>
                <li>URL Management: Users can view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs within the application, providing them with control and flexibility over their links.</li>
                <li>API Integration: The project can also include an API that allows other applications to interact with the URL shortener service programmatically.</li>
                <li>The project utilizes Django's MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to separate the concerns and provide a structured development approach. Django's built-in features such as user authentication, database management, and URL routing simplify the development process.</li>
                <br>
                <b>Overall, the URL shortener project using Django aims to provide users with a user-friendly and efficient tool for shortening URLs and managing their shortened links effectively.</b></span>
